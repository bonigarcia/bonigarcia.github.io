abstract = {Context:
Selenium is a widely used tool for end-to-end (E2E) web testing. However, it is often criticized for brittleness, slowness, and flakiness. In parallel, newer frameworks and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are reshaping the test automation landscape.
Objectives:
This study aims to investigate current practices, challenges, and emerging trends in Selenium-based test automation.
Methods:
We designed and executed a large-scale online survey targeting software professionals who use Selenium. The questionnaire covered technical practices, tooling, AI usage, perceived challenges, and competing tools.
Results:
A total of 88 complete responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics and thematic coding. The results show that Selenium remains the dominant tool for regression and functional testing, primarily using the Page Object Model (POM) pattern. The most reported challenges are related to assertability, asynchrony, and brittleness. AI tools like ChatGPT are gaining traction for test generation. Playwright is the most prominent alternative.
Conclusion:
While Selenium is recognized as a cornerstone in many automation workflows, its limited native test-specific features present a significant drawback. The findings indicate an increasing demand for testing-focused improvements within the Selenium ecosystem, as well as for enhanced integration with AI-driven development tools.}
